# ðŸ§¥ Fashion MNIST Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items.

ðŸ“Š Accuracy Achieved
âœ… Test Accuracy: ~92%
âœ… Validation Accuracy: Up to 91.8% during training


ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The model is a deep CNN built using keras.Sequential. Below is the architecture:

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])



ðŸ§ª Training Summary
Epochs: 10

Batch Size: 64

Validation Split: 10%

The model was trained on the normalized and reshaped Fashion MNIST data. During training, the model quickly improved to over 90% accuracy within a few epochs.
